We have used smote to balance the dataset.
Then we have used Logistic Regression to train the model and got a training score of 96.3%.
We have checked if there was overfitting, and saw that there was a testing score of 95% which is quite excellent.
Even the ROC score is close to 0.992 which is almost 1.
